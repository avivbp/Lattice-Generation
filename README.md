This is the github repository for Lattice Generation Workshop in Computational Learning.
In this repository you will find all pieces of code used to create our results.

The following is an explanation for how to reproduce the results we show in our report:

1) Training Co-Mod-GAN
1) Image Completion Using Co-Mod-GAN:
2) Image Completion Using FCNN:
3)
